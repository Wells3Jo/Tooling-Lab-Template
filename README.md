## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 
I deserve 10/10 points on this assignment.
## Self-Reflection:
The tooling instructions were not completely accurate and took some extra time to figure it out.
It seems to be that cypress wants to constantly process which causes it to fail sometimes and succeed others. I had to redo the cypress script because I misunderstand the end of the assignment.

### How long it took me to finish this?
It took me 2 hours for this assignment.
